# Hello, I'm Daniel Nziranziza 👋

## About Me

💪 I've realized that my strengths lie in learning and hard work!

I'm a Software Developer based in Kigali, Rwanda. I'm passionate about coding and enjoy building applications that solve real-world problems. In addition to my coding journey, I've recently discovered a keen interest in listening to tech podcasts.

## 🎙️ Must listen Podcasts

- [React Native Radio:](https://open.spotify.com/show/28hPRLml3FbP14FCYtlOvg?si=4a2d9d59d8b54a29) I enjoy listening to this podcast featuring engineers who witnessed the growth and popularity of React Native. This podcast is crucial for gaining a deeper understanding of React Native and mobile programming in general. It covers all aspects of mobile programming, from native apps and hybrid apps to mobile web apps

- [Backend Panther:](https://open.spotify.com/show/35trT95UkRVCkEb6tXndpF?si=66c8b0f27f9b42b3) Lane Wagner is an advocate of the Go programming language. Before this podcast, I didn't know much about Go programming, but I have learned a lot since then. I was also introduced to several other strongly typed programming languages like Rust. As a JavaScript developer, it is always interesting to learn how it performs among other languages.

- [PodRocket:](https://open.spotify.com/show/6oFuKu89C9X1wQ7bT0QEM2?si=73b636ebfddd4d8e) This is my newly discovered podcast. I have listened to a few episodes, and I will be updating this description to give my honest opinion about it. But to sum up, it is all about web development and is hosted by LogLocket
